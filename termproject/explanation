Lead - Lag Compensator Design for Companzanting Second Order Systems 
In this project, Lead-Lag Compensator has been designed so that the system can operate in accordance with the desired conditions (maximum overshoot, settling time...).
Balanced and unbalanced system outputs were compared using Proteus.
Controller Design and tests were tested on Matlab and Simulink platforms, and then the theoretical calculations and simulation results of the project were reported.
